# Exercises - JavaScript Fundamentals II

These exercises require involve all the building-blocks of JavaScript with a healthy dose of problem solving. Tackle them in any order. Scan through each first to see which one interests you the most.

## Exercises

Remember, as a beginner you're probably prone to two things:

1. Diving head-first into the code
1. Focusing on the syntax and not your own model of the problem

Each of these exercises is *something you can already do* by hand. Use that to your advantage. Slow down, step out of the code, and play with simple examples to make your intuition more precise.

### [Format Seconds][dir-format-seconds]

In [formatSeconds][dir-format-seconds], you're asked to turn an integer representing a total number of seconds into a nicely formatted string.

### [Add Commas][dir-add-commas]

In [addCommas](./exercises/addCommas), you're asked to write a function that formats a number by inserting commas in the appropriate places.

For example, converting `12345` to `'12,345'`.

### [Convert To Roman Numerals][dir-to-roman]

In [toRoman](./exercises/toRoman), you're asked to write a function that takes a number and returns a string containing its representation in Roman numerals.

For example, converting `1327` to `'MCCCXXVII'`. We explain how Roman numerals work if you've never seen them before or don't remember.

### [Convert Number to English][dir-number-to-english]

In [numberToEnglish](./exercises/numberToEnglish), you're asked to write a function that converts an integer to its english equivalent.

For example, converting `12345` to `'twelve thousand three hundred forty five'`.

### [Run-Length Encode][dir-run-length-encode]

In [runLengthEncode][dir-run-length-encode], you're asked to implement a simple compression algorithm called *run-length encoding*.

### [Run-Length Decode][dir-run-length-decode]

In [runLengthDecode][dir-run-length-decode], you're asked to write a function that decompresses strings compressed using run-length encoding.

Do [runLengthEncode][dir-run-length-encode] first.
